This trippy movie with Brenden Frasier. I remember getting a kick out of it when I was a younger. It came out early 2000's I believe. Brenden Frasiers character died and ends up in purgatory where he is met with a lot of interesting creatures in a very stylized environment. There is a monkey character that was something he drew for a comic strip or something, but now, in this world, it has come to life. The monkey character is kind of a rascal haha.
